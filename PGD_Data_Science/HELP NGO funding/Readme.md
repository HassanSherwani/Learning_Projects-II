# HELP NGO funding
We, HELP International humanitarian NGO, committed to fight poverty and provide the people of
backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities. We
run a lot of operational projects from time to time, along with advocacy, drives to raise awareness as well
as for funding purposes.
# Problem statement:
During the recent funding programmes, we have been able to raise around $ 10 million. As an analyst, we
have to come up with the countries list that are in the direst need of aid.
