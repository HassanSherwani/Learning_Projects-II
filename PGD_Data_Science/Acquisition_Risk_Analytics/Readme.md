# Problem Statement

CredX is a leading credit card provider that gets thousands of credit card applications every year. 
But in the past few years, it has experienced an increase in credit loss. The CEO believes that the 
best strategy to mitigate credit risk is to ‘acquire the right customers’. <br>
In this project, our task is to help CredX identify the right customers using predictive models. Using 
past data of the bank’s applicants, we need to determine the factors affecting credit risk, create 
strategies to mitigate the acquisition risk and assess the financial benefit of our project. 

# Key Objectives

- To identify the right customers using predictive models. We need to determine the factors affecting credit risk 
  and create strategies to mitigate the acquisition. 
- Build an application scorecard and identify the cut-off score below which we would not grant credit cards 
  to applicants.
- In the end, we need to assess and explain the potential financial benefit of our project and identify the metrics we are trying to optimize.
